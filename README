# Description
This project implements a shell that can run most UNIX commands and can be installed into your linux environment. There are also some add-on commands such as bg, fg, l, ll that are created and included in this shell.

## Dependency
- sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

## Installation Process
The installation process is very easy, with several simple commands:

1. autoreconf -i (only if "configure" is not present)
2. ./configure
3. make
4. sudo make install

After installation, the shell can be used directly by typing "shell" anywhere in Linux. Have fun!

# Redefined/Created Commands ( [] means optional )
1. change directory 
    cd [dest]
2. list directory 
    ls [flags] [dest]
    flags:
    1. -a   (list all files in directory)
    2. -l   (list files vertically)
    3. -d[0-3] (change default printing format, 0="ls", 1="ls -l", 2="ls-a", 3="ls -al")
3. quick list of files in directory 
    l                           ( same as ls -l )
4. quick list of all files in directory 
    ll                          ( same as ls -al )
5. background and foreground commands
    - bg [any_UNIX_command...]    ( command run in background with std redirected )
    - fg [any_UNIX_command...]    ( command will run in foreground, like linux )
    - [any_UNIX_command] [&/bg]      ( if [&/bg] is included, command runs in background )
6. background running process 
    jobs                        ( prints out all background running process )
7. kill processes
    kill [pid] [pid2...]        ( kill process(es) )
8. quit shell
    quit                        ( Ctrl C will not terminate the shell )

To be continued...

# Updates
If you would like to modify the shell yourself, by simply "make" and "sudo make install", the shell should be able to be updated. Otherwise, you can try to reset or clean the whole file and re-install it:

[Re-Configuration]
1. make clean
2. ./configure
3. make
4. sudo make install

[Re-Generate_the_config_files]
1. make reset
2. autoreconf -i
3. ./configure
4. make
5. sudo make install
